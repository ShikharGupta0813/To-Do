# üìù Kanban Task Management App

A full-stack **Kanban Task Management Application** that helps users to manage their tasks visually. It includes **Smart Assignment** of tasks, **Drag-and-Drop** task handling, **Conflict Detection**,**Priority of Tasks**, **Activity Logs**, and **Authentication**.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a feature-rich Kanban Board where users can:

* **Create**, **Edit**, **Delete** tasks
* Drag-and-drop tasks between columns (Todo, In Progress, Done)
* Set Priority for tasks (High, Medium, Low)
* Smartly assign tasks to the user with the **fewest active tasks**
* Tasks inside each column are shown in **decreasing priority order** (High first)
* Tasks have title validations ‚Äî cannot match column names and must be unique
* Track all actions in a **Live Activity Log** (real-time via sockets)
* Handle task **conflicts** smartly (with options to Keep Server Version or Overwrite with My Changes) during **edits or drag-and-drop**

| Smart Assignment       | Automatically assigns task to the user with the fewest active tasks         |
| Conflict Handling      | Detects concurrent edits & offers merge or overwrite options                |
| Real-Time Activity Log | Logs actions such as task creation, deletion, status change, and edits (via socket.io) |
| Priority Levels        | Assign and update task priority (Low, Medium, High)                         |
| Priority Ordering      | Tasks in each column are automatically sorted by priority (High to Low)     |
| Task Title Validation  | Prevents duplicate task titles and disallows titles same as column names     |

## üîç Logic Explanations:

### ‚úÖ Smart Assign Logic:

* Backend checks all users.
* Counts their *active* tasks (tasks not marked 'Done').
* Assigns task to the user with **fewest active tasks**.

```js
const users = await User.find({});
for (let user of users) {
  const count = await Task.countDocuments({ assignedUser: user._id, status: { $ne: 'Done' } });
  if (count < minTasks) targetUser = user;
}
```

### ‚úÖ Conflict Handling Logic:

* When updating, version check is done to avoid overwriting newer data.
* If conflict detected, app shows modal with two choices:

  1. **Keep Server Version**
  2. **Overwrite With My Changes**
* Resolves according to user‚Äôs choice.

```js
if (req.body.version !== undefined && task.version !== req.body.version) {
  return res.status(409).json({ message: 'Conflict detected', currentTask: task });
}
```
